Orb-v3 <sup>1,2</sup> is a next-generation universal machine learning interatomic potential (MLIP) developed by Orbital Materials, achieving significant breakthroughs on the Pareto frontier of performance-speed-memory trade-offs. This model series includes multiple variants covering different configurations from high-precision conservative types to high-efficiency sparse graph non-conservative types, making it suitable for a wide range of computational chemistry tasks.

The scripts are built upon the Orb-V3 force field model.
